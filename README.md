## Installation

You will need `python` 3.3 or above to be able to use these basic bots. To be able to use the different bots without running into any issues of dependencies, follow these steps:

1. In the terminal (MacOS/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) run `pip install virtualenv` or `pip3 install virtualenv`.

2. Create a python virtual environment by typing in your terminal/command prompt either `python3 -m venv NAME_OF_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT` if you are in Linux/MacOS or `python -m venv NAME_OF_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT` where you can substitute `NAME_OF_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT` by any name of your preference.

2. Activate your environment by running in the MacOS/Linux terminal `source NAME_OF_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT/bin/activate` or `.\NAME_OF_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT\Scripts\activate` in the command prompt in Windows. **You are going to have to follow this step every time you want to use the bots.**

3. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` either in your terminal or command prompt.

4. Well done! You are ready to go and start using the bots. Make sure to read the **README.md** inside each of the folders for each service, e.g. `coinbase` folder and follow the set up so you don't run into any issues.x
